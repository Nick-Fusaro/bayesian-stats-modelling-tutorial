    "\n",
    "This is a condensed tutorial for Bayesian statistical modeling for people who approach things from a computer science POV, subsetted out of Eric Ma's excellent [tutorial](https://github.com/ericmjl/bayesian-stats-modelling-tutorial) to run for a much shorter time. I assume no math knowledge outside of arithmetic (though there is one proof) and competence with NumPy, Pandas, and Python control flow (loops, conditionals, et cetera). In order to get through all the material, we'll have to rush through a fair amount of the exercises. I'd suggest that if you don't know all those things above to pair up with someone who does. The concepts are more important than their implementation, so don't get concerned if you don't have time to finish every exercise.\n",

    "\n",
    "> To the pioneers such as Bernoulli, Bayes and Laplace, a probability represented a _degree-of-belief_ or plausibility; how much they thought that something was true, based on the evidence at hand. To the 19th century scholars, however, this seemed too vague and subjective an idea to be the basis of a rigorous mathematical theory. So they redefined probability as the _long-run relative frequency_ with which an event occurred, given (infinitely) many repeated (experimental) trials. Since frequencies can be measured, probability was now seen as an objective tool for dealing with _random_ phenomena.\n",
