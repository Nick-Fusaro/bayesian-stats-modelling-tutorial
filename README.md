# bayesian-stats-modelling-tutorial-subset

How to do Bayesian statistical modelling using Numpy and PYMC3. Shamelessly plagarized from Eric Ma's [really good tutorial here](https://github.com/Nick-Fusaro/bayesian-stats-modelling-tutorial/commits?author=ericmjl), to fit into a short, introductory 90 minute lecture. Acknowledgements, the full tutorial, and oodles of additional information and great examples can all be found there, and I suggest you give it a go.
